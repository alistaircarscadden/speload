i. Spelunky

Spelunky is a cave diving platformer that was created by Derek Yu, it features 5 main areas (caves, jungle caves, ice caves, underground temple, hell) as well as many sub-levels (black market, haunted house, mothership, worm, city of gold). There are many styles of playing the game, but there is one main goal, which is beating the game. Beating the game can be done in two ways, by killing Olmec, a large stone statue located at the end of the temple, or by killing Yama, a throne-perched man located at the end of hell, to get to Yama you must first kill Olmec and enter a secret door hidden in Olmec’s lair. Other goals include beating the map in under 8 minutes, with the world record being just over 2 minutes, beating the game without acquiring any items other than the original 4 bombs, 4 ropes, and 4 hearts you begin with, or beating the game with as much gold as you can get.
      
ii. Motherload

Motherload is a mine-digging platformer that was created by xGen Studios. It features no directly separated levels, though you can dig to extreme depths eventually reaching hell. The goal of this game is to beat Satan in hell. Instead of the mainly-linear flow of Spelunky, in Motherload you must travel down until you either run out of fuel, cargo space, or are too damaged to continue, at which point you return to the surface to prepare yourself for another trip. You do this until you have the fuel, cargo space, and hull to make it all the way to hell. On the way down you are given messages from Mr. Natas who at the beginning of the game is shown to be your boss, but in the end turns out to be the bad guy. 
      
iii. Speload

The path Speload will take to be a hybrid of Spelunky and Motherload is to use the mining mechanic and idea from Motherload, and the level and cant-go-back ideas from Spelunky. There will be 7 levels, 5 dirt levels and 2 temple stone levels. At the end of each section there will be a “boss level” of some sort. Dying at any point will end the game displaying the menu screen and your (possibly new) highscore, which is the amount of minerals you collected (the better the more they are worth, deeper levels have more expensive minerals) multiplied by what level you got to, or 8 if you beat the 2nd boss, rewarding both safety and thoroughness.

1. The Menu Screen

The menu screen has 4 elements:
•	Background 
o	A nice randomized landscape that is 20x20 blocks, with each block being 30x30. 
o	Each landscape will have a blue sky, ground with elements and maybe even some lava.
•	Title (SPELOAD!)
•	Your highscore
•	Options:
1.	Play
2.	Highscores (top 10)
3.	Settings (there r nun lol)
4.	Exit

The menu screen is still, there is no movement going on while idle. Pressing 1-3 will activate the appropriate option, which will be numbered on the screen. 

2. The Minerals

Name	Colour	Value	Level	Rarity
Copper	Light Brown	3	>0 (s.o1)	Common
Iron	Li-Med Grey	4	>1 (s.o2)	Common
Silver	Silver	5	>2 (s.o3)	Less Common
Gold	Gold	6	>4 (s.o5)	Not Common

Gem	Blue	7	>5 (s.o6)	Rare
	Red	7	>5 (s.o6)	Rarer
	Green	7	>5 (s.o6)	Rarerer
Diamond	Pale Light Blue	8	>6 (s.o7)	Rarererer

3. The Scoring

The score will be calculated by taking the amount of each mineral you collected multiplied by the value of that mineral, and multiplied by the level you reached.

Example:
Name	Amount
Copper	123
Iron	75
Silver	32
Gold	8
Gem	9
Diamond	0

Level reached: 8

If the player completed the game their score would be calculated as:
((123*3)+(75*4)+(32*5)+(8*6)+(9*7))*8 = 7520

4. The Infinite Levels

The game will consist of an infinite amount of levels. Every level will have an exit point randomly placed at the bottom row of tiles. When you enter a new level by finding the exit at the bottom of the previous level, you start at the top with the same X coordinate as the door was on the previous level. Entering a new level will generate the level (see 5.) 

5. The Level Generator

*The Character you control is called “You”
Due to the limited mobility of You, there are limitations on how you can navigate a level. Each level will be generated with a mixture of dirt and stone. The dirt is mineable, and the stone is not mineable. The dirt contains ores, some are hidden and some are visible. The reason for this is that you shouldn’t be able to enter a room and calculate what the most profitable route will be, there should be some element of surprise. The stone will block the paths as seen in this diagram where the blue line is the path you take, and the red is the area that you can’t go after you pass the green line.
 
The deeper You ventures into the Caves of Sadness the more stone will generate, this will be done by keeping track of the level that You is on and using that to randomly generate stone. Lava: There will also be lava generated that is hidden, but when struck will end your game via You’s death.  Lava is more common the deeper You ventures.

6. Ways You Dies

The main cause of You’s death in the Caves of Sadness is running out of fuel. Fuel is shown on a bar at the top left of the screen. You has 20 fuel points, 1 fuel point is used for every empty block mined that contains a mineral or fuel, empty tiles are free. This rewards skipping minerals to preserve fuel if needed.
